Configuration for publishing to R-Universe


## Purpose

This repo's sole purpose is to hold a single configuration file that tells the R-Universe github app which repos from our Organization to publish as packages on the R-Universe platform. Any repos that we wish to publish to that platform must be added to the configuration json here.
